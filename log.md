# Thesis log

In this markdown file i'll be briefly logging the day to day progress on the thesis.

## March - April

The general goal of this period is to get a good understanding of the "representation" and "disentanglement" concepts in the context of deep learning. I'll be reading papers and books on the topic, while also brushing up on multivariate statistics and some probability theory.

- March 5 - March 24: 
    I reviewed many core math, machine learning and deep learning concepts from the following sources:

    - Probability and some measure theory from my uni courses books.
    - Chapter 6 and 7 of Goodfellow's Deep Learning book.
    - Introductory chapters on Elements of Statistical Learning.

- March 25:
    - Incorporated simple information theory intuition, such as what "entropy" and "information" mean, and the relationship between cross-entropy and log-likelihood estimation.
